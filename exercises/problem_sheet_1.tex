\begin{exercise}
    (Inversion and Rejection)
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\it Let $Y \sim \operatorname{Exp}(\lambda)$ and let $a > 0$. We consider the variable after restricting its support to be $[a, +\infty)$.
    That is, let $X = Y_{|Y \ge a}$, i.e. $X$ has the law of $Y$ conditionally on being in $[a, +\infty)$. Calculate
    $F_X(x)$, the cumulative distribution function of $X$, and
    $F^{-1}_X(u)$, the quantil function of $X$. Describe an algorithm to
    simulate $X$ from $U \sim \unif[0,1]$.}

    If $x \ge a$, we have that
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            F_X(x) &= \pr(Y \le x \mid Y \ge a) \\
            &= \frac{\pr(Y \in [a, x])}{\pr(Y \ge a)} \\
            &= \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda x} - (1 - e^{-\lambda a})}{e^{-\lambda a}} \\
            &= 1 - e^{-\lambda(x - a)},
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    otherwise, $F_X(x) = 0$. Let $u = 1 - e^{-\lambda(x - a)}$. Inverting this
    function, we get that 
    $$
    F_X^{-1}(u) = a-\frac{\log(1 - u)}{\lambda}.
    $$

    A simple algorithm is the following 
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Let $U \sim \unif[0,1]$. 
        \item Define $X = F_X^{-1}(U)$. Then $X$ has the desired distribution
        by the inversion method. 
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item {\it Let $a$ and $b$ be given, with $a < b$. Show that we can simulate $X = Y_
    {|a \le Y \le b}$ from $U \sim \unif[0,1]$ using
    $$
    X= F_Y^{-1}(F_Y(a)(1 - U) + F_Y(b)U),
    $$
    i.e. show that if $X$ is given by the formula above, then $\pr(X \le
    x) = \pr(Y \le x\mid a \le Y \le b)$. Apply
    the formula to simulate an exponential random variable conditioned to
    be greater than a, as in the previous question.}

    Using the properties of the (generalized) inverse and some affine
    transformations, note that
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \pr(X \le x) &= \pr(F_Y^{-1}(F_Y(a)(1 - U) + F_Y(b)U) \le x) \\
            &= \pr(F_Y(a)(1 - U) + F_Y(b)U \le F_Y(x)) \\
            &= \pr(U(F_Y(b) - F_Y(a)) \le F_Y(x) - F_Y(a)) \\
            &= \pr\left(U \le \frac{F_Y(x) - F_Y(a)}{F_Y(b) - F_Y(a)}\right) = \frac{F_Y(x) - F_Y(a)}{F_Y(b) - F_Y(a)}.
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    However, 
    $$\frac{F_Y(x) - F_Y(a)}{F_Y(b) - F_Y(a)} = \frac{\pr(Y \le x) - \pr(Y \le
    a)}{\pr(Y \le b) - \pr(Y \le a)} = \pr(Y \le x \mid Y \in [a,b]),$$
    what concludes that $X$ has the same distribution of $F_Y^{-1}(F_Y(a)(1 -
    U) + F_Y(b)U)$. 

    Taking $b = +\infty$, we can simulate $U \sim \unif[0,1]$ and use 
    $$X = F_Y^{-1}(F_Y(a)(1 - U) + U).$$

    \item {\it Here is a simple algorithm to simulate $X = Y_{|Y > a}$ for $Y
    \sim \operatorname{Exp}(\lambda)$:}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\it Let $Y \sim \operatorname{Exp}(\lambda)$. Simulate $Y = y$.}
        \item {\it If $Y > a$ then stop and return $X = y$, and otherwise, start again at step (a).}
    \end{enumerate}

    {\it Show that this is just a rejection algorithm, by writing the proposal
    and target densities $\pi$ and $q$, as well as the bound $M = \max_x
    \pi(x)/q(x)$. Calculate the expected number of trials to the first
    acceptance. Why is inversion to be preferred for $a \gg 1/\lambda$?}

    The target density $\pi(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F_X(x) = \lambda
    e^{-\lambda(x-a)}1_{\{x \ge a\}}$ is the density of $X$, while the proposal density
    is the exponential $q(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}1_{\{x \ge 0\}}$. Therefore, the bound
    is 
    $$
    M = \sup_{x \ge 0} \frac{\pi(x)}{q(x)} = \sup_{\{x \ge a\}} e^{\lambda a} = e^{\lambda a}. 
    $$
    The probability of accepting $X = y$ is 
    $$
    \alpha(y) = \frac{\pi(y)}{Mq(y)} = \begin{cases}
        0, &\text{ if } y \le a \\
        1, &\text{ if } y > a.
    \end{cases}.
    $$
    This is only the rejection sampling algorithm. Let $N$ be the number os
    trials to the first acceptance.  We already know that $N$ is geometrically
    distributed with parameter $M^{-1} = e^{-\lambda a}$. In our case, this is
    easy to see, because, 
    $$
    \pr(N > n) = \pr(Y \le a)^n = (1 - e^{-\lambda a})^n.
    $$
    We conclude that $\ev[N] = e^{\lambda a}$. When $a \gg 1/\lambda$, we have
    that $\ev[N] \gg e$ and several trials are rejected until a desired
    sample come. In that case, is much simpler to use the inversion method.  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
    (Rejection)
    Consider the following ``squeeze'' rejection algorithm for sampling from a
    distribution with density $\pi(x) = \tilde{\pi}(x)/Z_{\pi}$ on a state
    space $\mathbb{X}$  such that
    $$
    h(x) \le \tilde{\pi}(x) \le M\tilde{q}(x)
    $$
    where $h$ is a non-negative function, $M > 0$ and $q(x) =
    \tilde{q}(x)/Z_q$ is the density of a distribution that we can easily
    sample from. The algorithm proceeds as follows.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Draw independently $X \sim q, U \sim \unif[0,1]$.
        \item Accept $X$ if $U \le h(X)/(M\tilde{q}(X))$.
        \item If $X$ was not accepted, draw an independent $V \sim \unif[0,1]$
        and accept $X$ if 
        $$
        V \le \frac{\tilde{\pi}(X) - h(X)}{M\tilde{q}(X) - h(X)}.
        $$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\it Show that the probability of accepting a proposed $X = x$ in either step (b) or (c) is}
    $$\frac{\tilde{\pi}(x)}{M\tilde{q}(x)}.$$
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \pr&(\text{Accept } X \mid X = x) = \\
            &= \pr(U \le h(x) / (M\tilde{q}(x))) 
            + \pr\left(U > h(x) / (M\tilde{q}(x))\right)\pr\left(V \le \frac{\tilde{\pi}(x) - h(x)}{M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x)}\right) \\
            &= \int_0^{h(x) / (M\tilde{q}(x))} \, du  + \left(1 - \int_0^{h(x) / (M\tilde{q}(x))} \, du\right)\int_0^{(\tilde{\pi}(x) - h(x)) / (M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x)} q(x) \, du \\ 
            &= \frac{h(x)}{M \tilde{q}(x)} + \left(1 - \frac{h(x)}{M \tilde{q}(x)}\right)\left(\frac{\tilde{\pi}(x) - h(x)}{M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x)}\right) \\
            &= \frac{h(x)(M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x)) + M\tilde{q}(x)(\tilde{\pi}(x) - h(x)) - h(x)(\tilde{\pi}(x) - h(x))}{M\tilde{q}(x)(M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x))}\\
            &= \frac{\tilde{\pi}(x)(M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x))}{M\tilde{q}(x)(M\tilde{q}(x) - h(x))} \\
            &= \frac{\tilde{\pi}(x)}{M\tilde{q}(x)}. 
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    \item {\it Deduce from the previous question that the distribution of the
    samples accepted by the above algorithm is $\pi$.}

    We know that given $X = x$, the probability of accepting $X$ is
    $\dfrac{\pi(x)}{q(x)}\dfrac{Z_{\pi}}{MZ_q}$. Therefore, 
    $$
    \pr(\text{Accept } X) = \int_{\mathbb{X}} \dfrac{\pi(x)}{q(x)}\dfrac{Z_{\pi}}{MZ_q} q(x) \, dx \\
    = \frac{Z_{\pi}}{MZ_q} 
    $$
    what implies that, by Bayes Theorem, the density of $X = x$ given that $X$
   was accepted is 
    $$
    \frac{\pi(x)}{q(x)}\dfrac{Z_{\pi}}{MZ_q}\frac{q(x)}{Z_{\pi}/(MZ_q)} = \pi(x).
    $$

    \item {\it Show that the probability that step (c) has to be carried out is}
    $$
    1 - \frac{\int_{\mathbb{X}} h(x) \, dx}{MZ_q}
    $$

    This probability can be written as 
    $$
    \pr\left(U > h(X) / (M\tilde{q}(X))\right) = 1 - \int_{\mathbb{X}} \frac{h(x)}{M\tilde{q}(x)} q(x) \, dx = 1 - \frac{\int_{\mathbb{X}} h(x) \, dx}{MZ_q}.
    $$

    \item {\it Let $\tilde{\pi}(x) = \exp(-x^2/2)$ and $\tilde{q}(x) =
    \exp(-|x|)$. Using the fact that }
    $$
    \tilde{\pi}(x) \ge 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}
    $$
    {\it 
    for any $x \in \R$, how could you use the squeeze rejection sampling
    algorithm to sample from $\pi(x)$. What is the probability of not having
    to evaluate $\tilde{\pi}(x)$? Why could it be beneficial to use this
    algorithm instead of the standard rejection sampling procedure?}

    Define $h(x) = \max(1 - x^2/2, 0)$. By the fact given above,
    $\tilde{\pi}(x) \ge h(x)$ for any $x \in \R$. Now, note that, 
    $$
    \sup_{x \in \R} \frac{\tilde{\pi}(x)}{\tilde{q}(x)} = \sup_{x \in \R} \exp(-x^2/2 + |x|).
    $$
    In order to maximize the above expression, suppose $x < 0$ is a
    local extreme, then 
    $$
    (-x - 1)e^{-x^2/2 - x} = 0 \implies x = -1. 
    $$
    Suppose now that $x > 0$ is a local extreme, then 
    $$
    (-x + 1)e^{-x^2/2 - x} = 0 \implies x = 1. 
    $$
    So the global maximum is attained at $x = -1$, $x = 0$ or $x = 1$. We have
    that 
    $$
    \sqrt{e} = \exp(-(-1)^2/2 + |-1|) = \exp(-1^2/2 + |1|) > \exp(0) = 1.
    $$
    Therefore, $\sup_{x \in \R} \tilde{\pi}(x)/\tilde{q}(x) = \sqrt{e}$. 
    Then, we have that 
    $$
    h(x) \le \tilde{\pi}(x) \le \sqrt{e} \tilde{q}(x)
    $$
    and we could use the  squeeze rejection sampling algorithm. 

    The probability of not having to evaluate $\tilde{\pi}(x)$ is the
    probability of accepting $X$ in step (b) that is 
    $$
    \int_{\R} \frac{h(x)}{M\tilde{q}(x)}q(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{e}Z_{q}}\int_{\R} h(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{e} Z_q} \int_{-\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} \, dx = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{e}} \approx 0.57, 
    $$
    since $Z_q = 2$. We have that calculating $h$ is simpler than $f$ and in
    half operations, we won't need to calculate it.  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
    (Transformation)
    Consider the following algorithm known as Marsaglia's polar method.
    \begin{enumerate}[{\bf Step (a)}] 
    \item Generate independent $U_1, U_2$
    uniformly in $[-1,1]$ until $Y = U_1^2 + U_2^2 \le 1$.  
    \item Define $Z = \sqrt{-2\log(Y)}$ and return $X_i = Z U_i/\sqrt{Y}$ for $i=1,2$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\it Define $\vartheta = \arctan(U_2/U_1)$. Show that the joint
    distribution of $Y$ and $\vartheta$ has density 
    $$
    f_{Y, \vartheta}(y,\theta) = 1_{[0,1]}(y)\frac{1_{[0,2\pi]}(\theta)}{2\pi}
    $$}
    Consider the transformation
    $$
    g(u_1, u_2) = \left(u_1^2 + u_2^2, \arctan(u_2/u_1)\right).
    $$ 
    The Jacobian of this transformation is 
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
        2u_1 & 2u_2 \\ 
        -u_2/(u_1^2 + u_2^2) & u_1/(u_1^2 + u_2^2)
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    and its determinant is $2$. Therefore, by the Change of Variable formula,
    since $u_2/u_1$ has image in $(-\infty, +\infty)$, we know that $\theta \in (-\pi/2,
    \pi/2)$. Besides that, is clear that $y \in [0,1]$. Therefore, 
    $$
    f_{Y, \vartheta}(y,\theta) = \frac{1}{8\pi/4}1_{\{\sqrt{y}(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)) \in [-1,1]^2\}}1_{\{y \le 1\}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}1_{[0,1]}(y)1_{[0,2\pi]}(\theta).
    $$

    \item {\it Show that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent standard normal random variables.}
    
    Putting $(U_1, U_2) = \sqrt{Y}(\cos(\vartheta), \sin(\vartheta))$, we have
    that 
    $$X_1 = ZU_1/\sqrt{Y} = \sqrt{-2\log(Y)}\cos(\vartheta), \quad X_2 =
    \sqrt{-2\log(Y)}\sin(\vartheta).$$
    Then, $(X_1, X_2)$ is a transformation of $(Y,\vartheta)$ which have uniform
    distribution over $[0,1] \times [0, 2\pi]$. The Jacobian of this
    distribution is 
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{-2}{2y\sqrt{-2\log(y)}}\cos(\theta) & -\sqrt{-2\log(y)}\sin(\theta) \\
        \frac{-2}{2y\sqrt{-2\log(y)}}\sin(\theta) & \sqrt{-2\log(y)}\cos(\theta),
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    whose determinant is 
    $$\frac{-\cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta)}{y} = -\frac{1}{y}.$$
    Note that $X_1^2 + X_2^2 = -2\log(Y) \implies Y =
    \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}(X_1^2 + X_2^2)\right\}$
     The density of the distribution of $(X_1, X_2)$ is 
    $$
    f_{X_1, X_2}(x_1, x_2) = \frac{1}{2\pi} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x_1^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x_2^2},
    $$
    which implies that $X_1, X_2 \overset{iid}{\sim}
    \operatorname{Normal}(0,1)$.
    
    \item {\it  What are the potential benefits of this approach over the Box-Muller algorithm?}
    
    The main beneficial part is that is not necessary to calculate any
    trigonometric functions, which are more expensive that logarithm.
