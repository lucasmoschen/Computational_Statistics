\section*{Background}

A large portion of the content of this course is concerned with computing high-dimensional integrals~\textit{via} simulation.
Today you will be introduced to a simple-looking problem with a complicated closed-form solution and one we can approach using simulation.

Suppose you have a disc $C_R$ of radius $R$. 
Take $p = (p_x, p_y)$ and $ q = (q_x, q_y) \in C_R$ two points in the disc.  
Consider the Euclidean distance between $p$  and $q$, $||p-q|| = \sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2 + (p_y-q_y)^2} = |p-q|$.
\paragraph{Problem A:} What is the \textit{average} distance between pairs of points in $C_R$ if they are picked uniformly at random?

\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item To start building intuition, let's solve a related but much simpler problem.
 Consider an interval $[0, s]$, with $s>0$ and take $x_1,x_2 \in [0, s]$~\textit{uniformly at random}.
 Show that the average distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is $s/3$.
 \item Show that Problem A is equivalent to computing
 \begin{equation*}
  I = \frac{1}{\pi^2 R^4}\int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2\cos\phi(\theta_1, \theta_2)}\,d\theta_1\,d\theta_2\,dr_1\,dr_2,
 \end{equation*}
 where $\phi(\theta_1, \theta_2)$ is the central angle between $r_1$ and $r_2$.
 
 \textit{Hint:} Draw a picture.
 \item Compute $I$ in closed-form.

 \textit{Hint:} Look up \textit{Crofton's mean value theorem} or \textit{Crofton's formula}. 
 \item Propose a simulation algorithm to approximate $I$.
 Provide point and interval estimates and give theoretical guarantees about them (consistency, coverage, etc).
