# Computational Statistics (["Estat√≠stica Computacional"](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/doutorado/estatistica-computacional))

Course materials for Computational Statistics, a PhD-level course at [EMAp](http://emap.fgv.br/).

## Lecture notes and other resources

We will be using the excellent [materials](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/teaching/AdvSim/18/index.html) from Professor Patrick Rebeschini (Oxford University) as a general guide for our course. 
Other materials, including lecture notes and slides may be posted here as the course progresses. 

## Simulation

- [Random Number Generation](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/papers/handstat.pdf) by [Pierre L'Ecuyer](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/);
- [Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation](http://www.nrbook.com/devroye/) by the great [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org/);


### Extra (fun) resources
