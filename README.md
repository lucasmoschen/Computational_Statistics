# Computational Statistics (["Estat√≠stica Computacional"](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/doutorado/estatistica-computacional))

Course materials for Computational Statistics, a PhD-level course at [EMAp](http://emap.fgv.br/).

## Lecture notes and other resources

We will be using the excellent [materials](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/teaching/AdvSim/18/index.html) from Professor Patrick Rebeschini (Oxford University) as a general guide for our course. 
Lecture [notes](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/courses/s227/)  by stellar statistician [Susan Holmes](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/) are also well worth taking a look.

Other materials, including lecture notes and slides may be posted here as the course progresses. 

[Here](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Computational_Statistics/blob/master/annotated_bibliography.md) you can find a nascent annotated bibliography with landmark papers in the field. 

## Simulation

- [Random Number Generation](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/papers/handstat.pdf) by [Pierre L'Ecuyer](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/);
- [Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation](http://www.nrbook.com/devroye/) by the great [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org/);

### Markov chain Monte Carlo

- Charlie Geyer's [website](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/) is a treasure trove of material on Statistics in general, MCMC methods in particular. 
See, for instance, [On the Bogosity of MCMC Diagnostics](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/mcmc/diag.html). 

### Extra (fun) resources

In these blogs and websites you will often find interesting discussions on computational, numerical and statistical aspects of applied Statistics and Mathematics.
